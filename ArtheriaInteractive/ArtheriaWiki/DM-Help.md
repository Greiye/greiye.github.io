Writing a Session - The Angry GM
A campaign begins with a goal and a major event to set the PCs on the path to resolving it and it ends when that story is resolved. Arcs begin with the revelation of some particular story element and end when that element is resolved or dealt with. Adventures begin with motivations and end with resolutions. Encounters begin with the posing of a dramatic question and end when the question is answered. And even individual actions begin with a situation, the choice of an action, a resolution, and a consequence. The game is like one of those pregnant Russian dolls with a smaller pregnant Russian doll in her stomach who, herself, has a smaller pregnant Russian doll inside.
(Mikey: This whole article is amazing and concise. I’m about to read this along with any session I plan out.

Magic’s Law of Exchange
Much like the rule of energy conservation, magic cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred into another form. 
	But unlike the natural law, magic’s depth of conversion can occur on the other side of the world.

100 limited entities in the world. When an entity is destroyed, it somehow is transmuted, taking another form in the world.

Portal
Portals to planes of existence.
5 points due to the many things that can come from outside the portal. The 5 points also act as the ‘nested limit’ before the portal closes.

This means that from a single portal, a resource or item can come from it, then closes once the 5 points are exhausted.

Mikey’s Post: In working with your co writers, the fellow DMs.
I created the Magic Law of Conservation for this reason.
There may be times where you don’t agree with your fellow DM by working together in a world. Often they say that in DnD you’re building a story together. But dude, what if they decide to make your favorite race losers? Or kill your favorite hero? Return this kindness by STORY COMBAT.

What do I mean by this? So. The Magic Law of Conversion. Long story short, magic in this world is not destroyed. It’s locked in an ecosystem that’s constantly changing. And every entity in this world has points (out of 100). Through creative story writing, you can knock off some points from an entity, killing it. This creates an imbalance in the system. You destroy an entity worth 5 points, so now the world’s points go from 100 to 95.

You can now use these 5 points to introduce new entities into the story. Whatever you want, so long as the rule of conservation is maintained; only 100 points of entities at a time.

(The Law of Magic Conservation became a personal use thing. Not fair to ask others to abide by it. Too limiting. Best used for a hard magic system.)

Example: Dragons and Tieflings (Introduced into the world by Jason and Mikey.)
Dragons are worth 2 points, Tieflings are worth 3, 5 points in total.
I want to rid the world of dragons to make the tiefling race stronger. I’m attached to tieflings because I wrote the lore for them. Jason is most likely attached to his lore as well. We’ll both do anything storywise to keep them alive. (With consent of course.)

Dragons are also classified as Creatures: Few. Dragons can add to their 2 points by absorbing another entity. They can also lose their points when another entity tries to absorb them.

Tieflings are a Race: Average Population, worth 3 Points. This means they have the upper hand in terms of killing the dragons through sheer number of units.

In a session, a DM should write the session with a planned change in points or entity number, minimum of 1 point, maximum of the destruction of an entity.

This becomes a thing of math, in accordance with the magic system.
Simple war of killing the dragons. 3(Tieflings)-2(Dragons)=1(Tieflings). The Cost for slaying all the dragons into extinction is the death of all the tieflings. The 1 represents the last of the Tieflings (preferably 1 person, to retain the chance of repopulation.)

So how does Jason’s Dragon lore fight against this equation? By using other entities in the magic system to increase the value of his dragons. This is when the math problem gets bigger. What other entity does he employ? What edge do I give my entities? This is the DM’s Story Combat. We are the gods that are fighting against each other for supremacy.

In fairness, The session needs to be written with a way of reintroduction for the other DM to retain his lore. If my tiefling lore manages to erase his dragon entities, then they need to be able to come back into the world. How? By the creation of a magic artifact: Dragon Eggs. Or maybe the last dragon egg, idk, whatever Jason wants. This is fair. This gives us a challenge to retain our lore.

Whoever loses their lore due to destruction gets the available points to introduce new lore. I think this is fair.

What makes a story?
Beginning, Conflict, Resolution. Fine tune that to your liking. Add more into it. All stories are stories of transformation. 

How do I make people enjoy my story?
Make it relatable. Ask what the player’s favorite setting is. Then give it a twist. Somelike like the 80/20 rule, where the 80 is their setting, and the 20 is the twist.
Tailor it to their character. This is why a session 0 is important. When you know the character that they want to play, you can give them several challenges to test their player. Part of session zero is asking them 3 to 5 questions that give you an idea of the goal that motivates that character. I personally organize everything in 4 sections: Physical, Mental, Social, and Financial (Logistics). Do they want to become stronger to survive combat? Do they seek knowledge? Increase their magical ability? Find a Tutor? Learn more of the world? Do they want to protect someone that they know? Get powerful artifacts? Become rich?

All stories are tales of transformation. The character from the beginning of their story should be considerably different when their story ends. This is what makes a good story.

Where do I get inspiration from?
Any popular show that you like. There’s a section here to help you get inspired.

How to tell a good story (from various technique on youtube)
-Show, don’t tell. Use varying,  clever words.
-Use evidence to support your claims
-Make the readers want it. This goes back to the character, and seeing them change and grow.
-Concrete facts, not abstract feelings when describing the world. Bring the world out.

Inspiration for fellow DMs
It’s awesome that my friends are now joining me as Dungeon Masters (DMs) in our D&D adventures. I really like this.

I joined the D&D Club in high school for 2 sessions. We played the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition, and the club was exactly what one would expect: a gathering of high school outsiders. I vividly recall how we projected the battlemap on a screen, allowing us to visually track our characters' positions during combat.

I chose to play as a fighter, and at that time, my creativity was soaring. I was captivated by the limitless possibilities of storytelling. Artistry ran through my veins even then.

One day, on a scrap of paper, I sketched Veilo—an original character inspired by Vahn from the Legend of Legaia video game. The inner child within me yearned to shape Vahn into something beyond the confines of his virtual world.

Thus, I crafted a human fighter, equipped with unique weapons reminiscent of Vahn's tonfa. Through this process, I realized that, for the first time, I had the opportunity to bring forth a character entirely of my own creation—a character akin to the likes of Harry Potter or Bobby Pendragon from the Pendragon Series.


Then I remember playing my character in combat. I felt the anxiety of contributing to combat, wanting to do damage to the monsters we were fighting. The DM at the time made it feel so visceral, more damaging than anything I've felt in video games. It felt a little more real.

After the game, I felt that I wanted more. I want to develop my character, make him stronger. I went home that day, and drew my character a few more times, trying to make him more real. I was just a kid projecting, wanting to be a hero in my own story. That’s what most people want to be. The main character in their own novel.

The feeling persisted. Thus, my interest in game development. At the time, that was impossible, as I didn’t know coding was even a thing, or how a kid could start doing that with my limited resources. I thought you were required to go to school for that. Thanks to 2023 technology, everyone can just do it themselves on even a low-end computer.

Years passed after my first time geeking out with a bunch of high school punks with a paper and pencil, playing what felt like a video game without the controller. I tried playing the essence of a tabletop game again with Kuya. On roll20.net, I created a poor story and had Kuya play with me. He was a fighter that ended up talking his way out of a fight with a bear. I didn’t have a world, a ruleset or anything, so it didn’t feel like a real game. It just felt like pretending. 

Then, Kuya decided to buy the beginners set of DnD, 5th edition. That fueled my interest yet again. This time I spent hours going through the rules, learning what I could.

After 50+ sessions, I’m where I’m at now, and I’m still inexperienced. My creative ability has improved, yes, but it took time and a lot of errors. A lot of disappointing my friends with poorly written stories that made them fall asleep. Often I was disappointed in myself.

What makes it worth it though, is crafting stories and events that we made together. Where we can remember them like we do Harry Potter scenes. And I’m in awe of that. We made that. Together. It’s not planned. It’s all spontaneous. These scenes that could happen in movies, happen right here, in someone’s living room. WE did that. Together. It’s like we’re authors working on a story together, where one day it’ll end up on the big screen, like Critical Role.

That’s what makes it worth the hours of planning.

In my dreams, these stories take a comic book form, in all of our libraries. And when we miss each other or want to relive the events of our fictional selves, we can go through and read those books or novels.

There’s 3 factions
The Status Quo (Name WIP)
They want to keep things the same. The tech lives in harmony with the environment.

The New Era
They’re another political party that’s found another tech type. It’s more efficient than what they have, taking advantage of the environment’s many resources. (One of them is harvesting a non-magical crystal called Cabault.)

A third group wishes to combine both technology. Creating this tech will take time, and the other groups know this.

The Fog problem
In the distance, a large cloud that threatens to shut down all the power grid. It’s been recorded by flyers to be moving in their direction for the past few weeks. Samples are inconclusive as to how long it’ll stay in the air.
Status Quo says the residents just need to be patient.
New Era demands that they need to start adapting the new tech NOW, before it’s too late.
Third Group needs more samples. They can develop the tech, rig an inefficient system that will work. Cost is that the new tech will most likely be used up.

Both the Status Quo and the New Era have greedy entrepreneurs that benefit from either decision.

It falls on the party to find which is the best solution.
The solution will change their society forever.
