Returning Keele
After successfully rescuing Keele from the Goblin infested tomb of Artesh, the party heads back to Assadorth
Lots of travelers in and out of assadorth
Town guard recognizes Keele. The guard advises us to return Keele quickly.
The Well
The party sees a well in the center of town. Over the well there are strange writings.
There is magic emanating from the well. Auri is helped by Thorvin to read out the sign on the well. "It sounds of Bahamut, the dragon god."
Welt throws a coin in. A local townsperson sees this and approaches. “Ah I see you worship Bahamut as well.”
The group returns to bringing Keele home. The father and daughter are reunited.
Kale asks “what happened to the other adventurers?”
The group thinks about it for a little bit. Some of them flashback to the undead mana emanating from the lower levels of the tomb. It is assumed that the previous visitors of the tomb have perished.)

Kane: As a reward for rescuing my daughter Keele,I want to give you folks a few magical artifacts.　I will also talk to the Red Dragon Inn and pay for the night’s accommodations; dinner and the rooms.

“I wish for you to have this.This coin has been in my family for some generations now.”
The Coin
The group has received a small coin. The faces are the same on each side. Auri senses that this item is enchanted.The group spends a fair amount of time examining the coin and its magical properties.
The Market District
The party heads to the business district to resupply. They visit the Tanner, the Trader, and the Leatherworker.
Sera manages to pawn all seven paintings that they found in the tomb of Artesh for 30gp each.
Welt commissions for a kind of leather carrier for Dezi and Zephyr.

Auri buys hide armor for 9gp from Tanner the Tanner(Leatherworker) and a Rapier for 25gp. Also caltrops and manacles. The 16 goblin ears begin to rot in his pack. Auri asks if any townsfolk collect these ears as a mark of lessened goblins. They tell him no. Seeing no use to the ears, Auri discreetly throws them in a random ditch by the roadside. 

Auri asks the locals if they've seen any silver dragonborns like him around. The Locals share that more information about them can be found in Brindol, Specifically from those that follow Bahamut. The chromatic dragon God would know about all of his subjects. They also tell him to check with the wizard up in the tower.

Auri earns 3 gold trying to pass as a blind beggar. Dezi and Welt throw stones at him.

Thorvinn attempted to buy 200gp of armor, but the armor was too expensive.

The group is still perplexed by the coin that Kane gave them.
After shopping around, they again find themselves in front of the Bahamut well. The coin shines after being dipped. The shining light fails mid flip. Any attempt to mark the coin fails, any magic mark or smudge of blood is removed the moment the coin flips in the air.

The party takes a drink of the well’s water. They are revitalized.


The Church

We go to the local church, which bears the symbol of Selune. A guard stops us, only allowing some of us inside. Welt and Thorvin enter.
When asked about Bahamut, the local priest or presbyter tells us that the markings of the Silver Dragon Guild are the same markings of Bahamut. Our Guild shares ties with the religion. Our current guild is considered the new guild, replacing the old one. (After that, the Sister said something about the sister of Selune?)

Welt: what was the issue with the old guild?
The Sister points to the graveyard,
Welt: Oh.

There are rumors of Goblins worshiping Tiamat, beginning to ritually sacrifice humans to appease the lord.
The Sister mentions Lorellia Vildremant (I think?) .The name of the Wizard.

Welt and Auri go to the wizard tower. A secretary meets us inside. “Wizard not here. come back tomorrow.”

The Stable
The group stops at the stable and inquires about horses.
Horses for 75gp
Donkey for 8gp
Wagon is 35gp

The Inn
The group goes to the Inn to rest.

Zephyr and Sera go right to sleep.
Welt studies the herbs collected in the Boar Forest.
Dezi uses this time to study the coin. After a thorough examination, he sees the coin for what it truly is. A magical artifact that once a day, can answer yes/no questions 10 times. Once per day, it can speak and answer a non-binary question.
Auri and Thorvinn get drunk. The Dragonborn drinks 8 total flagons of ale in 4 hours, while Thorvinn drinks 13 in a single hour. Auri wakes up with a hangover while Thorvinn does not, because of his Dwarvish tolerance to alcohol and poisons.

Noon Foursday, Firius 4, 1090
Day 3 of the Adventure
The new Gnome Harness should be complete by now. Zephyr picks it up from the leatherwork shoppe. 
There’s a commotion in the residential district. The party investigates.
While the party was asleep, two children were taken from their homes in the residential district. The kidnappers used the cover of night to bypass the guards. Much like Keele's kidnapping, there are 2 sets of humanoid tracks that lead from the Northeast as well as the West. Boar forest is in the North. To the West is a jungle/swamp area.

With newfound power, Welt uses dark magic to talk to a black cat. Welt asks the cat if he saw anyone last night. The cat says that all humans look alike. Aside from that, there were yellow human-like things last night. (Most likely goblins or some kind of variant.)
The black cat named Stevie gestures like a hound dog and points west with his snout.
“Speak to the other side of town. Find a brown cat named Freddy, who guards that side of Assadorth.”
(Someone mention the Golden Dawn Brigade? Who is Captain Rivas? Three injured goblins?)
The Mayor’s Manor
The group go to the Mayor’s Husk’s Manor (That also doubles as a kind of schoolhouse). Sera kicks the door down to Mayor Husk’s abode. The party interrupts the Mayor’s meeting with 5 other people:

-A Half Orc
-An Elf with silk purple clothing with instrument on her back
-A Kobold
-Another Elf. Auri can see that she has an arcane focus on her left hilt, exuding mana. Through Mayor Husk, the group discovers that this elf is the local Wizard who lives in the tower. This Elvish woman is Lorellia Vildremant.
-Halfling

Lorellia: “I avoid talking to the common plebeian.”

This could very well be the Golden Dawn Brigade.

End of Session 3.
