End of Session 6
Level Up to Lvl 3


In the room with vines hanging overhead: Goblins begin to move in. Auri and Dezi hear them talking.

Auri exposes himself to speak in Goblin, telling them that his team is an infiltration team, sent by Bahamut. This causes the 3 goblins to further train their arrows on Auri. There is unease. Tension. Anger in the air. Auri shapes water behind him, using ice figurines to inform his party about the 3 goblins archers in front of him.

"Boss!" one of the 3 goblins calls out.
A larger goblin appears. Goblin Boss as the other goblins refer to him. They say they're looking for the relic as well.

Goblin Boss
"You mentioned higher ups. Which higher ups are you referring to?"

Goblins
"Who goes there? Reveal Yourself!"

Auri
"Oh, here, they gave you a recording on a stone lemme just hand that to yo-ICE KNIFE

A shard of ice flies out, catching one of the goblins in the neck.
The Goblin boss uses a goblin from behind as a shield effortlessly. A small stack of goblin bodies forms from the Boss's figure, immediately 30 ft down.

Auri kills 3.
Zephyr rushes and punches an archer on the ground vine level.

Dezi sends out a firebolt from his crucible. It burns the goblin boss

Sera tells the grounded goblin archer that he needs to apologize to his momma, which sends him into a catatonic state.

In retaliation, the goblin boss throws a javelin and it kills the one catatonic goblin. There is a hint of regret on the boss's face. He says something along the lines of 'I meant to do that' or 'Let that be a lesson to you.``

Goblins Boss says "Kill the Kid."
Queue time constraint for the group to rescue the child.
Zephyr tries to throw Dezi up the 30ft cliff face. Fails. Dezi recovers by doing a cartwheel back to safety. Auri and Welt make 10/10 signs to appreciate Dezi's sudden gymnastic ability.
