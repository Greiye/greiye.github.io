Story continues right after the group leaves the Western Jungle Caves. The group recover one of the two relics found in the caves. The other relic a glowing blade, was swiftly taken by a Kobold, that the party assumes is from the Golden Dawn Brigade.

- There is mention of the magical coin. One side is believed to be true, up to 10 times per day.
- Dezi Weighs about 49lbs.



Nighttime
On the way home to Assadorth, the group encounter a strange, hooded female figure in the night. She stands among the leaves and brush.
Sera: "Hey!"
No response.
Sera: "If you want to fuggin' ignore me that's fine, I guess"
The figure leaves.

Sera: "Psst! Hey! I saw a hooded lady!"
Zephyr: "It was dark, you just saw shadows.
Sera: "I'm telling you I saw something! Are you calling me a liar? Do you think I'm lying?"
Zephyr: "No, I think you're crazy!"

Zephyr rouses everyone up. They spend some time looking for the hooded woman.
To no avail. If there was a woman around, she's gone.

Sunrise
Desi infuses a weapon. (I don't remember who's and with what)

The hooded figure reveals herself.
???: "My name is Tia Lovestrand.


She appears as an Elven woman, with a long ponytail. Her face is covered up with a fabric mask.
Tia: "I ask of you for help. I am by origin, exiled, from an Elven town to the North. I have settled in Assadorth for 10 years, and it is only now that I cannot enter the town.
While I fare decently among nature, It is uncomfortable. 100 yards away from Assadorth's gates, I am transported to my Elven town, a distance away."

Auri asks Tia: "Do you know this child?"
He picks up the saved child from the caves.

Tia:
No, I do not know who this is.
(I'm not sure if she said this.)

All I can remark is... the town of Assadorth is an oddity.

Thorvinn and Co.:
"Will you join us? " to Assadorth. Let's see what happens when you're close to Assadorth gates."

Tia nods.
She follows the group to Assadorth.
When the party is close enough, everyone watches as Tia kneels over, then disappears.

The party is lightly shocked. With nothing else to say to this, they continue on their way to return the child.

Assadorth Guard
"Oh, you found the kid, huh? Good on you. (Or something like that.)

The child simply leaves the party, and straight to his home. (or her?)

Afternoon
#### Mayor Husk's Manor/Schoolhouse

Dr. Engineer?

???:
The Mayor will see you now.
Thorvinn presents the sword from the caves. (I don't remember the reaction to it.)

??? Party:
"Mayor Husk, do you know someone named Tia Lovestrand?"
Husk:
"...No. I don't. Should I?"
??? Party:
"..."
Dezi fixes his glasses to sit properly on the bridge of his nose. This is what the untrained eye sees. In reality, he's just casted detect magic on Mayor Husk's office.
Not a single item shines with mana, not even Dezi's belongings, which are undeniably charged and infused with magical energy.

This means that there is something off with the Mayor's office. A potential anti-magic field. The mayor may or may not be aware of this.

Husk:
"Come back to my office tomorrow. I'll have your reward prepared. Until then, rest easy. You have done the town a service by bringing home one of the missing children. The Golden Dawn Brigade managed to bring home the other child even sooner; just yesterday actually."

"I'll send word to the Red Goblin Inn. You need not worry about the price of lodgings or accomodations. It will be covered by the mayor's purse. Good Day."

The group begins to leave. Auri stops.

Auri:
"Vildremant... she is where?"

Husk:
"Most likely in her tower, as usual."

Auri:
"..."
Auri makes a "W" with both hands.

:
"West sideeeeeeee" (A reference from an earlier session.)
Welts returns, seeing this display of ignorance from the corner of his eye and slaps Auri's hands down. Auri looks at his direction in feigned disapproval.

.......

(A potentially had conversation, I forgot who said what.)

Thorvinn:
"This town truly is odd. The night of the kidnappings, a guard had been injured; another slain. Yet nothing changes."

Zephyr:
"You think they're... letting them get taken?"

Thorvinn:
"Hmm. Hard to say. Maybe that elven woman had a point. Maybe there was something to Assadorth."

Zephyr:
"Oh, the Elven woman with the... "*gestures with his hands that she had large breasts
"Tia Tittykaka. Tia Tamera. Tia Sweet-tits. Something like that."

The Well of Bahamut
Along the way, the group sees another person paying homage to Bahamut by flipping a coin into the well.
(There is talk, I forgot what exactly. I think they said that Bahamut saved the town of Assadorth, according to Mayor Husk?)

The group splits ways for a few moments.

Captain Rivas
Auri and Zephyr

Zephyr:
"Let me do the talking."

???
"...Honored to help Assadorth.
I've been in town for about 5 years.

???
"...Vildremants? Tell us what you know."

Captain Rivas:
"Oh, the Vildremant family? They've been in Assadorth for about 10 years now, as wizards.
Lorelia's parents are still alive. "(One parent is an elf and a human, maybe)
They're known for their magic, research, and notable action."

As long as 'you guys' have been around."

(You guys? The captain remembers us. Maybe as the Silver Dragon Guild.)
Auri notices that the captain's gear is  slightly magical.

Auri/Zephyr
What can you tell us of Tia Lovestrand?

Captain Rivas:
"I... have no memory of who that is."

Zephyr's and Auri's Thoughts

Is Assadorth in some kind of magical bubble? Is there an anti-magical field that stems close to Mayor Husk's Manor? Is this a curse? Could the cult be involved?

Someone mentions that Dezi's arm does look like dragon scales.

The Well, Again
The same guy from the other time is still paying homage to Bahamut.
Mentions "Tiamat, the Queen of the Chromatic Dragons", and King Tiamat, the King of Dragons"
"It was king Bahamut that once saved Assadorth from bandits." (Or did Mayor Husk say this?)
The party looks at his reactions. It seems the man genuinely believes that Bahamut saved Assadorth.

The Blacksmith Kane and the sword
Thorvinn, Sera and Dezi

**Thorvinn** <br> 
"I need you to take a look at this sword. We found it in the Western Jungle caves."

Kane <br>
"I'll take a look."

The group meets back up, at the Vildremant Wizard Tower.

Vildremant Wizard Tower
5PM, Some sunlight out.

The same human male servant from before answers the door.

Servant<br>
"... Yes? A visit for Ms. Lorelia Vildremant, I suppose?"

Auri nods.

Servant<br>
"... She is indisposed at the moment. You may wait outside."

Auri<br>
"Wait. Sure a wizard as esteemed as Vildremant has a waiting area for her visitors?"


"No, she does not."

Auri<br>
"Ah. So. You mean to say that your master does not have the resources for a simple room for those that wish to see her?"

"Yes. There is no waiting room."

Auri<br>
"Hmm."

"You may wait here until you are received."

1 hour passes.

"She is still busy. You may continue to wait out here."

Thorvinn<br>
"WHELP. I'm not waiting around for her. I'm headed to the Inn."

Thorvinn leaves to consume copious amounts of meat and ale at the Red Goblin Inn.

Another hour passes.

7PM. Nightfall.

"She is ready to receive you now."

...

As the party heads up, Auri makes small talk.

Auri<br>
"So... servant. What is your name?"

???
"... My name is Brett."

Auri:
"..."

Brett: Vildremant’s Servant from the tower.
....

The party enters Vildremant's study, which from the outside appears to be the 5th or 6th level of the tower.

Although Auri cannot see the area as the others do, he does note that to him, the room is radiantly bright with the sheer magical pressure of tomes and artifacts. The difference is night and day.

:
Vildremant appears with her tan brown skin, blonde hair and signature cigarette from her long holder.

Lorelia Vildremant<br>
"Oh. It's you. What do you want?"

Some members of the group ask her questions.

Auri: "Where is the Kobold?"
Vildremant: "...Who?"
Auri: "You know who I'm talking about. The Kobold. He was there, in the Western Jungles caves with us as we saved the child."
Vildremant: "I haven't the slightest who you're talking to."
Auri: "... Both our groups were to work together for the benefit of Assadorth. This is not how you treat your allies."
Vildremant: "We don't need allies. The Golden Dawn Brigade is more than capable of handling these tasks ourselves."

Zephyr<br>
"Tell us more about the cult."

Vildremant:<br>
"Which one? There isn't just one, after all."

Auri<br>
"You won't tell me anything about my tribe, are you?"

Vildremant<br>
"... Information. What I want is information. A trade. You give me what I want, You'll get your information."

Auri<br>
"And what do you want from me?"

Vildremant<br>
 "... Artifacts."

Auri Asks about Tia Lovestrand
Auri: 




The group continues to talks to Vildremant, asking questions.

Vildremant<br>
"There is something you can help me with. "
It's for the Bard of the Brigade. (From a previous session, It's known that she wears a purple silk shirt and has an instrument slung over their shoulder.)

"I need information on... A short sword that bears the image of a fish."

Auri remembers that the short sword that Thorvinn gave to the Blacksmith Kane had an insignia, 'The Singing Fish', written in Infernal. (Translated by Sera, Session 7, Western Jungle Caves).

Auri casts message behind his back to Zephyr
"I know about this. I'll tell you later."

"Ahem."
Vildremant: "You are in the bowels of the Vildremant Tower, surrounded by many an arcane artifacts, in front of Vildremant herself. You think to cast a spell in front of me and presume I wouldn't notice?"

Auri<br>
"We'll have information about this 'singing fish', ready for you by tomorrow. Shall we set up an appointment?"

Vildremant looks annoyed.

Vildremant<br>
"...Not before my meeting with Husk. I assume you'll be there, as well."
"It will have to be then. Have it ready."

The group leaves the tower.

Auri tells the group what he knows.

Auri<br>
"The information that the witch wants, is related to that short sword that Thorvinn recovered. It has a singing fish and some text, inscribed in Infernal. Sera read it out to us."
"That short sword is our one card hand in the game that Vildremant plays. Let's see what she and the mayor have in store for us tomorrow."

Inn
The group relax at the inn. Some go right to sleep, some have a meal.

The Next Day
Mayor Husk's Manor
The two groups collect in the Mayor's office. It's spacious enough for the 10+ group of people. Among the Golden Dawn Brigade, there is not only Vildremant, but the Kobold that she said she knew nothing of.

Auri sees the Kobold’s mana. He casts the message spell and whispers to him. With the help of Zephyr, he sends a message.

Auri<br>
"The Kobold, he's there?"

Zephyr<br>"No, here, I'm gonna point at him with your middle finger. To the right, yeah- right there."

Auri<br>
"Ah."

"FUCK YOUUUUUUU. You can reply to this message." Auri points angrily with two middle fingers, with the fingers pointed towards the kobold horizontally rather than in the vertical tradition. The Kobold hears him telepathically, but does not reply.

Husk:
"Ah, good, you're all here."
"Let's keep this short. First and foremost, thank you to both teams for promptly returning the children. The Golden Dawn Brigade brought home one of Assadorth's futures, with the other team following suit just a day later.
So. The Relics."

Husk<br>
*reveals a map. <br>
"It seems that the goblin cult, or whoever is taking our children, needs these relics for a ritual of some kind. We know where these relics are."

Husk points to 4 places on the map on his desk. The 4 points have wooden miniatures depicting the area's climate.

"There's a relic in the Volcanic Mountains here, in the Snowy Tundra, the Swamps and the Feylands.

It doesn't matter to us if you two groups work as a team or against each other to recover these artifacts. What's important is keeping the relics away from the hands of bad actors.

The two parties huddle up.

Thorvinn: Okay. Which one are we doing first?
Welt: Auri, aren't you based on cold magic? So you would excel in the tundra.
Sera: I'm not ready to face my family just yet.
Dezi: What do you mean by that, Sera?
Zephyr: What about Feylands?
Welt: My Patron is Fey. I think I'll have an advantage there.
Sera: Let's go to the Feylands.
Auri: I vote for the Feylands as well. That's 3v3.
Zephyr: I vote for Feylands as well.
Thorvinn: Looks like we're going to the Feylands.

Auri reaches into his pocket and brings out a key ring of goblins ears, kept in fresh condition by cold magic. Auri separates a specific goblin ear from the rest.

Auri: "For Dak."(Session 7, the Goblin that was taken captive and killed by the Brigade's Kobold)

Welt: "Oh Gods- throW that awaY alreaDYY"

End of Session 7
