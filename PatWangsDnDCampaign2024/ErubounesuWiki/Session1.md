### The Red Goblin Inn
In the town of **Assadorth**, an unlikely group of adventurers find each other. *The Silver Dragon Guild* seem to have hired each of them to find the missing daughter of the local blacksmith, but was not informed of each other.

Inside the Red Goblin Inn, A red Tiefling is causing a stir with an older chef in her 40's, about the establishment's food quality. In the tavern side, a half elf monk sits with 10 flagons of ale. A halfling with 2 crucibles on each side of him, an emaciated human in formal attire and bandages, and a blind dragonborn. A ruckus is caused, which ends with each of these adventurers sitting at the same table. Seeing that they are all affiliated with the Silver Dragon Guild, They agree to work together. They quickly introduce themselves:

**Seraphina “Sera” Flameheart** - A Tiefling Cook, who wishes to prove herself to her family's lineage of cooks.

**Zephyr Ironfist** - Half Elf Monk who solves every problem with punches. He seeks to solve the problem that is his father.

**Welt** - Plague Doctor who seeks knowledge.

**Dezi** - Halfling Artificer with a metallurgical disease that he wishes to cure.

**Auri** - A seemingly blind Silver Dragonborn magic user who is looking for his lost dragonborn tribe. Joined the guild for magic.

They were all sent here about a missing girl.
## The Blacksmith’s Daughter

They interview some of the local people around. Using their combined brain cell, they decipher that the best person to go to about the blacksmith's daughter is the blacksmith themselves.
The party goes to the blacksmith's smithy. They meet Kane, a Halfling blacksmith. They find out several key pieces of information, her potential whereabouts, what she looks like:
The daughter's name is Keele; A Halfling child, with red hair, last seen wearing a commoner's shirt and pants. 

The party departs, headed to what the locals call as The Boar Forest. There, they find humanoid tracks as described by the blacksmith. They follow the tracks. Along the way, they find medicinal herbs (Auri and Welts find 5 and 4, respectively)

## Night Camp

The party gathers around the campfire, and share with each other a brief of who they are and what they seek.

Zephyr wants to solve the problem that is his father with his fists.

Welts seeks knowledge and secrets of medicine.

Seraphina wants to prove herself to her family.

Dezi reveals his 'ferroderma' condition as he puts it and seeks a cure. Welts is intrigued by this condition.

Auri puts on a show, using magic to manipulate water. He shows that he was blinded as a child, and that he's looking for his lost clan of fellow Silver Dragonborn.

With a 3 shift night watch, the party rests until daybreak.
